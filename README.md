After successfully Log in, you will be directed to a Main Page where you can start adding your tasks into a **To do List**

> Notice that you have and **id code** which you could share with your friends.

In the main page, you will have a **money calculator**.
The calculator calculates the fine money based on 4 variables:

1. Not Completed: the number of days that you could have not finished your tasks
2. Starting amount: the initial amount of the fine money
3. Increment: the increment amount after a number of not completed days
4. Not completed before Increment: the amount of days that you may not be able to complete the tasks before the increment amount is added and create new starting amount
   > So, if the starting amount you want is $5, the increment is $1, and the "not completed before increment" is 2 days.
   >
   > 1. Then the first day not completed, you need to pay a total of $5
   > 2. The second day not completed, you need to pay a total of $10 ($5 + $5)
   > 3. But, on the third day, the increment is applied. If you missed any task on the third day, the fine of the day is $6, which means the total is now $16.
   >
   > And so on,...
